//Goal: Design a Car class composed of parts like Engine, Wheel, and Door.
// Each part has its own behaviors (e.g., a door can open/close, a wheel can be inflated/deflated).
//To-Do:
//Create a Car class with nested Engine, Wheel, and Door classes.
//Allow the hero to start the engine, open all doors, inflate a wheel, and close the trunk.
//Add methods for each car partâ€™s actions and create interactions between them.
// Gradual Challenge: Introduce class composition and object interactions through methods like starting the engine and checking wheel pressure.
