public interface TwoDimensionalShape {

//Define interfaces TwoDimensionalShape (with methods area() and perimeter()) and ThreeDimensionalShape (with methods volume()).
//Create classes Square, Circle, and Cube that implement these interfaces as appropriate.
//In each class, define relevant attributes (e.g., side for Square and radius for Circle).
//Implement constructors for each shape that display a message, such as “A new square has been created.”
//Create a main class ShapeShifterWorkshop to create and display the properties of each shape.
